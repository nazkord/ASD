 **Breadth-first search (BFS)** is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
 It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 
 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
 Implement **BFS** using pseudocode from Cormen, this why my vertex structure has three different colors.
