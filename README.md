# ASD
Here I'll drop some cool tasks from ASD (Algorithms and Data Structures). ASD is a main subject in IT faculty in AGH in 18/19. 
Those tasks mainly based on different sorting algorithms, trees and graphs. 
Don't judge my code, some of tasks are made just because of my curiosity "))

In each folder, there are many task with **description** and in the code there are **comments** to facilitate undestanding of the solution.

## Other task

In this folder there are some tasks from **tests (kolokwium)** with content (treść).
